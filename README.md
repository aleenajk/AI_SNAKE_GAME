# AI_SNAKE_GAME
This project implements the classic Snake Game and trains an AI agent to play it using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The agent learns through trial and error with techniques like Q-learning / Deep Q-Networks (DQN), optimizing its strategy to maximize rewards (eating food) while avoiding collisions
